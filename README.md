# StadiumBot

A bot for querying WRs and history for the [Smash Stadium Discord](https://discord.gg/3D6YjWJ). You can see the list of commands by using '/' in the Discord.

## Issues/Feature Requests:  
Please open an issue on github or DM me on Discord megaqwertification#3976. You may submit a PR too and let me know if there are issues I need to sort out.

## Thanks to:
- IRL friend - you know who you are
- sockdude1 - mmbot plus helping
- Judge9 - additional help
- various stadium community members - for input
- Stadium Discord - Too many google sheets even though i dont want this to be the defacto tracker of things. just a tool to access things quickly

# IDEAS / TODO*:
- Add character regex
- view_record command (not priority, but still doable)
- recordcount command
- sus/mismatch command verification
- top 10 leaderboard per char
- RTTF and EFB records
- NOT 2p-4p , I think that's better for a separate, larger database with its own functionality
- Pipe dream: a website with more database functionality

*idea being here does not mean I'll implement it. I do not want to oversaturate the bot with commands.
